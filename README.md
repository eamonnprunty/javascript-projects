Repository for my JavaScript Projects while at The Tech Academy.

During this course, I practiced with JS in many different ways including expressions, functions, mathematical operators, creating dictionaries, coercion, ternarny operators, constructors, scope of functions, manipulating strings, creating and styling slideshows, as well as utilizing loops and arrays.

I also created many projects included in the next section.
