Repository for my JavaScript Projects while at The Tech Academy.

During this course, I practiced with JS in many different ways including expressions, functions, mathematical operators, creating dictionaries, coercion, ternarny operators, constructors, scope of functions, manipulating strings, creating and styling slideshows, creating a basic "to-do app", as well as utilizing loops and arrays.
